This repository provides the MATLAB codes of the numerical simulations of the following paper:

*Y. Watanabe, K. Sakurama, Distributed Optimization of Clique-Wise Coupled Problems via Three-Operator Splitting.*

One can examine and generate the same figures as ones in the paper in the following procedure:

1. Run `init.m`.
2. Run `run_ex1.m` or `run_ex2.m`.

Please note that one needs to install `cvx` in advance.
